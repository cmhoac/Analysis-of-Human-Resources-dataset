# Analysis-of-Human-Resources-dataset
Built a data warehouse based on information about employees, then analyzed the data to gain insights into the dataset, after that created reports for visualization and finally applied data mining to predict employeeâ€™s termination.
+	Designed and implemented a Data Warehouse using the Star Schema, creating Fact and Dimension tables to structure employee-related data.
+	Developed an ETL pipeline using SSIS to extract, transform, and load data into the warehouse, ensuring data integrity and efficient processing.
+	Built analytical models with SSAS by defining Cubes, Measures, and Hierarchies, enabling multi-dimensional data analysis using MDX queries and Pivot Tables.
+	Created interactive reports using SSRS and Looker Studio, visualizing key insights such as employee salary trends, department performance, and workforce distribution.
+	Applied Data Mining Techniques by conducting preprocessing, feature selection, and implemented machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest) to uncover patterns in employee data.
